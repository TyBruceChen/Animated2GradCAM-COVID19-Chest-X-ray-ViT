This is the COVID-19 diagnosing visualization in Vision Transformer by our research: [A Vision Transformer Machine Learning Model for COVID-19 Dagnosis Using Chest X-Ray Images](https://github.com/TyBruceChen/Research-A-Fined-Tuned-ViT-for-COVID-19-Image-Auxiliary-Diagnosing/tree/main).

Specifically, I would like to thank Dr. Toby Hocking, who introduced and created the powerful [animint2](https://github.com/animint/animint2) R package.

The [Version2](https://github.com/TyBruceChen/Animated2GradCAM-COVID19-Chest-X-ray-ViT-V2-200px-696Case) is available with 696 cases with 200*200 resolution
